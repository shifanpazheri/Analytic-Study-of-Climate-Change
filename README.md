# Analytic-Study-of-Climate-Change
This is an analytic study using Google Earth Engine in order to find climate changes in India. This is done as a part of Engineering Economics.
Climate Change is a huge predicament, however the public perception is still mixed. Our aim is to do a thorough data analysis and see if any of the data we obtain can further our understanding on this subject.
We used the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data on Surface Temperature of 11 cities in india (Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Delhi, Jaipur, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar).
We extracted the temperature data of these 11 cities for the years 2011-2020 and we performed univariate analysis.
Machine learning analysis we came to a conclusion that temperature change is not a myth but it's a reality and the average temperature across indian cities will raise by 0.75 K in next 10 years
